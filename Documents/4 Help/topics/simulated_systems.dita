    <p>Simulated systems can be configured under the CAN-bus by following the steps given below. Select <menucascade>
        <uicontrol>Configure</uicontrol>
        <uicontrol>Simulated Systems</uicontrol>
      </menucascade> menu option. This will display the window as shown is figure below.</p>
    <p>There are two panes in the <uicontrol>Configure Simulated Systems</uicontrol> window as shown in figure below.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Left Pane</title>
      <p>This will have the details of all simulated systems listed in a tree fashion. Will be called Pane 1.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Right Pane</title>
      <p>This pane will display the details of each node that you select from the Pane1. Will be called Pane 2.</p>
      <p>By default no simulated system is configured. Once the user adds or creates simulated systems under CAN Bus  it will be stored across sessions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>New Simulated System</title>
      <p>To configure a new simulated system under CAN Bus, please follow the steps given below</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select root item in Pane 1 and right click.</li>
        <li>A pop-up menu will be displayed as shown in figure below.</li>
        <li>Select <uicontrol>New Simulated System</uicontrol> menu option.</li>
        <li>A dialog box will be displayed.</li>
        <li>Key in the new simulated system name and select <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The new simulated system path is added as last item in the Pane 1.</p>
