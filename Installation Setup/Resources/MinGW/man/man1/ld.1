.SH "NAME"
ld \- Using LD, the GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ld [ options ] objfile...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\f(CWld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \f(CWld\fR.
.PP
\f(CWld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the 
\f(CWld\fR entry in \f(CWinfo\fR, or the manual
ld: the GNU linker, for full details on the command language and 
on other aspects of the GNU linker. 
.PP
This version of \f(CWld\fR uses the general purpose BFD libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \f(CWld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or
\f(CWa.out\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
\f(CWld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
.PP
The GNU linker \f(CWld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \f(CWld\fR is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file \f(CWhello.o\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        
\&        ld -o I<output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
.Ve
This tells \f(CWld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW/lib/crt0.o\fR with \f(CWhello.o\fR and
the library \f(CWlibc.a\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \f(CWld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker can not recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\f(CWINPUT\fR or \f(CWGROUP\fR to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way should only be used to augment the main
linker script; if you want to use some command that logically can only
appear once, such as the \f(CWSECTIONS\fR or \f(CWMEMORY\fR command, you
must replace the default linker script using the \fB\-T\fR option.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace-symbol\fR and
\fB--trace-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note \- there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case \*(L'o\*(R' can
only be preceeded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB--omagic\fR sets the NMAGIC flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\fB--trace-symbol foo\fR and \fB--trace-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note \- if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(eg \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        
\&          gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
.Ve
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU
linker:
.Ip "\f(CW-a\fIkeyword\fR\fR" 4
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.Ip "\f(CW-A\fIarchitecture\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--architecture=\fIarchitecture\fR\fR" 4
In the current release of \f(CWld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \f(CWld\fR configuration, the
\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  
.Sp
Future releases of \f(CWld\fR may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
.Ip "\f(CW-b \fIinput-format\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--format=\fIinput-format\fR\fR" 4
\f(CWld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \f(CWld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \f(CWld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \f(CWld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
The default format is taken from the environment variable
\f(CWGNUTARGET\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\f(CWTARGET\fR;
.Ip "\f(CW-c \fIMRI-commandfile\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--mri-script=\fIMRI-commandfile\fR\fR" 4
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI\s0, \f(CWld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \f(CWld\fR scripting language.
If \fI\s-1MRI\s0\-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \f(CWld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.Ip "\f(CW-d\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-dc\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-dp\fR" 4
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CWFORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\fR has the same effect.
.Ip "\f(CW-e \fIentry\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--entry=\fIentry\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\fB0\fR for base 8).  
.Ip "\f(CW-E\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--export-dynamic\fR" 4
When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CWdlopen\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the version script to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB--version-script\fR in \f(CW@ref\fR{\s-1VERSION\s0}.
.Ip "\f(CW-EB\fR" 4
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.Ip "\f(CW-EL\fR" 4
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.Ip "\f(CW-f\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--auxiliary \fIname\fR\fR" 4
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
\fIname\fR.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
.Sp
This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
.Ip "\f(CW-F \fIname\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--filter \fIname\fR\fR" 4
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\fIname\fR.
.Sp
Some older linkers used the \f(CW-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.  The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this
purpose: the \f(CW-b\fR, \f(CW--format\fR, \f(CW--oformat\fR options, the
\f(CWTARGET\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CWGNUTARGET\fR
environment variable.  The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \f(CW-F\fR
option when not creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.
.Ip "\f(CW-fini \fIname\fR\fR" 4
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW_fini\fR as
the function to call.
.Ip "\f(CW-g\fR" 4
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.
.Ip "\f(CW-G\fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--gpsize=\fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the \s-1GP\s0 register to
\fIsize\fR.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
\s-1MIPS\s0 \s-1ECOFF\s0 which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.
.Ip "\f(CW-h\fIname\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-soname=\fIname\fR\fR" 4
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
.Ip "\f(CW-i\fR" 4
Perform an incremental link (same as option \fB\-r\fR).
.Ip "\f(CW-init \fIname\fR\fR" 4
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting \s-1DT_INIT\s0 to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW_init\fR as the
function to call.
.Ip "\f(CW-l\fIarchive\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--library=\fIarchive\fR\fR" 4
Add archive file \fIarchive\fR to the list of files to link.  This
option may be used any number of times.  \f(CWld\fR will search its
path-list for occurrences of \f(CWlib\fIarchive\fR.a\fR for every
\fIarchive\fR specified.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \f(CWld\fR may also search for
libraries with extensions other than \f(CW.a\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \f(CWld\fR will search a directory for a library with
an extension of \f(CW.so\fR before searching for one with an extension of
\&\f(CW.a\fR.  By convention, a \f(CW.so\fR extension indicates a shared
library.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate \fIfile\fR\|(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \f(CW-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \f(CWld\fR on \s-1AIX\s0, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.
.Ip "\f(CW-L\fIsearchdir\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--library-path=\fIsearchdir\fR\fR" 4
Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \f(CWld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \f(CWld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\f(CW-L\fR options apply to all \f(CW-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \f(CWld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\f(CWSEARCH_DIR\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.
.Ip "\f(CW-m\fIemulation\fR\fR" 4
Emulate the \fIemulation\fR linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the \fB--verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.
.Sp
If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
\f(CWLDEMULATION\fR environment variable, if that is defined.
.Sp
Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.
.Ip "\f(CW-M\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--print-map\fR" 4
Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:
.Ip "\(bu" 8
Where object files and symbols are mapped into memory.
.Ip "\(bu" 8
How common symbols are allocated.
.Ip "\(bu" 8
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.
.Ip "\f(CW-n\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--nmagic\fR" 4
Turn off page alignment of sections, and mark the output as
\f(CWNMAGIC\fR if possible.
.Ip "\f(CW-N\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--omagic\fR" 4
Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do
not page-align the data segment.  If the output format supports Unix
style magic numbers, mark the output as \f(CWOMAGIC\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW-o \fIoutput\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--output=\fIoutput\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIoutput\fR as the name for the program produced by \f(CWld\fR; if this
option is not specified, the name \fIa.out\fR is used by default.  The
script command \f(CWOUTPUT\fR can also specify the output file name.
.Ip "\f(CW-O \fIlevel\fR\fR" 4
If \fIlevel\fR is a numeric values greater than zero \f(CWld\fR optimizes
the output.  This might take significantly longer and therefore probably
should only be enabled for the final binary.
.Ip "\f(CW-q\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--emit-relocs\fR" 4
Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked exececutables.
Post link analysis and optimization tools may need this information in
order to perform correct modifications of executables.  This results
in larger executables.
.Ip "\f(CW-r\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--relocateable\fR" 4
Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \f(CWld\fR.  This is often called \fIpartial
linking\fR.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
\f(CWOMAGIC\fR.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking \*(C+ programs, this option \fIwill not\fR resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use \fB\-Ur\fR.
.Sp
When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some \f(CWa.out\fR\-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.
.Sp
This option does the same thing as \fB\-i\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW-R \fIfilename\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--just-symbols=\fIfilename\fR\fR" 4
Read symbol names and their addresses from \fIfilename\fR, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.  You may use this option more than once.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \f(CW-R\fR option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the \f(CW-rpath\fR option.
.Ip "\f(CW-s\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--strip-all\fR" 4
Omit all symbol information from the output file.
.Ip "\f(CW-S\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--strip-debug\fR" 4
Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.
.Ip "\f(CW-t\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--trace\fR" 4
Print the names of the input files as \f(CWld\fR processes them.
.Ip "\f(CW-T \fIscriptfile\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--script=\fIscriptfile\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIscriptfile\fR as the linker script.  This script replaces
\f(CWld\fR's default linker script (rather than adding to it), so
\fIcommandfile\fR must specify everything necessary to describe the
output file.  You must use this option if you want to use a command
which can only appear once in a linker script, such as the
\f(CWSECTIONS\fR or \f(CWMEMORY\fR command.    If
\fIscriptfile\fR does not exist in the current directory, \f(CWld\fR
looks for it in the directories specified by any preceding \fB\-L\fR
options.  Multiple \fB\-T\fR options accumulate.
.Ip "\f(CW-u \fIsymbol\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--undefined=\fIsymbol\fR\fR" 4
Force \fIsymbol\fR to be entered in the output file as an undefined
symbol.  Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional
modules from standard libraries.  \fB\-u\fR may be repeated with
different option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
option is equivalent to the \f(CWEXTERN\fR linker script command.
.Ip "\f(CW-Ur\fR" 4
For anything other than \*(C+ programs, this option is equivalent to
\fB\-r\fR: it generates relocatable output---i.e., an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \f(CWld\fR.  When linking \*(C+ programs, \fB\-Ur\fR
\fIdoes\fR resolve references to constructors, unlike \fB\-r\fR.
It does not work to use \fB\-Ur\fR on files that were themselves linked
with \fB\-Ur\fR; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use \fB\-Ur\fR only for the last partial link, and
\fB\-r\fR for the others.
.Ip "\f(CW--unique[=\fISECTION\fR]\fR" 4
Creates a separate output section for every input section matching
\fI\s-1SECTION\s0\fR, or if the optional wildcard \fI\s-1SECTION\s0\fR argument is
missing, for every orphan input section.  An orphan section is one not
specifically mentioned in a linker script.  You may use this option
multiple times on the command line;  It prevents the normal merging of
input sections with the same name, overriding output section assignments
in a linker script.
.Ip "\f(CW-v\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--version\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-V\fR" 4
Display the version number for \f(CWld\fR.  The \f(CW-V\fR option also
lists the supported emulations.
.Ip "\f(CW-x\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--discard-all\fR" 4
Delete all local symbols.
.Ip "\f(CW-X\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--discard-locals\fR" 4
Delete all temporary local symbols.  For most targets, this is all local
symbols whose names begin with \fBL\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW-y \fIsymbol\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--trace-symbol=\fIsymbol\fR\fR" 4
Print the name of each linked file in which \fIsymbol\fR appears.  This
option may be given any number of times.  On many systems it is necessary
to prepend an underscore.
.Sp
This option is useful when you have an undefined symbol in your link but
don't know where the reference is coming from.
.Ip "\f(CW-Y \fIpath\fR\fR" 4
Add \fIpath\fR to the default library search path.  This option exists
for Solaris compatibility.
.Ip "\f(CW-z \fIkeyword\fR\fR" 4
The recognized keywords are \f(CWinitfirst\fR, \f(CWinterpose\fR,
\f(CWloadfltr\fR, \f(CWnodefaultlib\fR, \f(CWnodelete\fR, \f(CWnodlopen\fR,
\f(CWnodump\fR, \f(CWnow\fR, \f(CWorigin\fR, \f(CWcombreloc\fR and
\f(CWnocombreloc\fR. The other keywords are
ignored for Solaris compatibility. \f(CWinitfirst\fR marks the object
to be initialized first at runtime before any other objects.
\f(CWinterpose\fR marks the object that its symbol table interposes
before all symbols but the primary executable. \f(CWloadfltr\fR marks
the object that its filtees be processed immediately at runtime.
\f(CWnodefaultlib\fR marks the object that the search for dependencies
of this object will ignore any default library search paths.
\f(CWnodelete\fR marks the object shouldn't be unloaded at runtime.
\f(CWnodlopen\fR marks the object not available to \f(CWdlopen\fR.
\f(CWnodump\fR marks the object can not be dumped by \f(CWdldump\fR.
\f(CWnow\fR marks the object with the non-lazy runtime binding.
\f(CWorigin\fR marks the object may contain \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR.
\f(CWdefs\fR disallows undefined symbols.
\f(CWcombreloc\fR combines multiple reloc sections and sorts them
to make dynamic symbol lookup caching possible.
\f(CWnocombreloc\fR disables multiple reloc sections combining.
.Ip "\f(CW-( \fIarchives\fR -)\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--start-group \fIarchives\fR --end-group\fR" 4
The \fIarchives\fR should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or \fB\-l\fR options.
.Sp
The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.
.Sp
Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.
.Ip "\f(CW-assert \fIkeyword\fR\fR" 4
This option is ignored for SunOS compatibility.
.Ip "\f(CW-Bdynamic\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-dy\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-call_shared\fR" 4
Link against dynamic libraries.  This is only meaningful on platforms
for which shared libraries are supported.  This option is normally the
default on such platforms.  The different variants of this option are
for compatibility with various systems.  You may use this option
multiple times on the command line: it affects library searching for
\f(CW-l\fR options which follow it.
.Ip "\f(CW-Bgroup\fR" 4
Set the \f(CWDF_1_GROUP\fR flag in the \f(CWDT_FLAGS_1\fR entry in the dynamic
section.  This causes the runtime linker to handle lookups in this
object and its dependencies to be performed only inside the group.
\f(CW--no-undefined\fR is implied.  This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0
platforms which support shared libraries.
.Ip "\f(CW-Bstatic\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-dn\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-non_shared\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-static\fR" 4
Do not link against shared libraries.  This is only meaningful on
platforms for which shared libraries are supported.  The different
variants of this option are for compatibility with various systems.  You
may use this option multiple times on the command line: it affects
library searching for \f(CW-l\fR options which follow it.
.Ip "\f(CW-Bsymbolic\fR" 4
When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the
definition within the shared library, if any.  Normally, it is possible
for a program linked against a shared library to override the definition
within the shared library.  This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0
platforms which support shared libraries.
.Ip "\f(CW--check-sections\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--no-check-sections\fR" 4
Asks the linker \fInot\fR to check section addresses after they have
been assigned to see if there any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make
allowances for sections in overlays.  The default behaviour can be
restored by using the command line switch \fB--check-sections\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW--cref\fR" 4
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
.Sp
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.
.Ip "\f(CW--defsym \fIsymbol\fR=\fIexpression\fR\fR" 4
Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
address given by \fIexpression\fR.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the \fIexpression\fR in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use \f(CW+\fR and \f(CW-\fR to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
using the linker command language from a script.  \fINote:\fR there should be no white
space between \fIsymbol\fR, the equals sign (``\fB=\fR''), and
\fIexpression\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW--demangle[=\fIstyle\fR]\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--no-demangle\fR" 4
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable \fB\s-1COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\s0\fR
is set.  These options may be used to override the default.
.Ip "\f(CW--dynamic-linker \fIfile\fR\fR" 4
Set the name of the dynamic linker.  This is only meaningful when
generating dynamically linked \s-1ELF\s0 executables.  The default dynamic
linker is normally correct; don't use this unless you know what you are
doing.
.Ip "\f(CW--embedded-relocs\fR" 4
This option is only meaningful when linking \s-1MIPS\s0 embedded \s-1PIC\s0 code,
generated by the \-membedded-pic option to the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler and
assembler.  It causes the linker to create a table which may be used at
runtime to relocate any data which was statically initialized to pointer
values.  See the code in testsuite/ld-empic for details.
.Ip "\f(CW--fatal-warnings\fR" 4
Treat all warnings as errors.
.Ip "\f(CW--force-exe-suffix\fR" 4
Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix.
.Sp
If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a
\&\f(CW.exe\fR or \f(CW.dll\fR suffix, this option forces the linker to copy
the output file to one of the same name with a \f(CW.exe\fR suffix. This
option is useful when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft
Windows host, since some versions of Windows won't run an image unless
it ends in a \f(CW.exe\fR suffix.
.Ip "\f(CW--no-gc-sections\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--gc-sections\fR" 4
Enable garbage collection of unused input sections.  It is ignored on
targets that do not support this option.  This option is not compatible
with \fB\-r\fR, nor should it be used with dynamic linking.  The default
behaviour (of not performing this garbage collection) can be restored by
specifying \fB--no-gc-sections\fR on the command line.
.Ip "\f(CW--help\fR" 4
Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and exit.
.Ip "\f(CW--target-help\fR" 4
Print a summary of all target specific options on the standard output and exit.
.Ip "\f(CW-Map \fImapfile\fR\fR" 4
Print a link map to the file \fImapfile\fR.  See the description of the
\fB\-M\fR option, above.
.Ip "\f(CW--no-keep-memory\fR" 4
\f(CWld\fR normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching the
symbol tables of input files in memory.  This option tells \f(CWld\fR to
instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol tables as
necessary.  This may be required if \f(CWld\fR runs out of memory space
while linking a large executable.
.Ip "\f(CW--no-undefined\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-z defs\fR" 4
Normally when creating a non-symbolic shared library, undefined symbols
are allowed and left to be resolved by the runtime loader.  These options
disallows such undefined symbols.
.Ip "\f(CW--allow-shlib-undefined\fR" 4
Allow undefined symbols in shared objects even  when --no-undefined is
set. The net result will be that undefined symbols in regular objects
will still trigger an error, but undefined symbols in shared objects
will be ignored.  The implementation of no_undefined makes the
assumption that the runtime linker will choke on undefined symbols.
However there is at least one system (BeOS) where undefined symbols in
shared libraries is normal since the kernel patches them at load time to
select which function is most appropriate for the current architecture.
I.E. dynamically select an appropriate memset function.  Apparently it
is also normal for \s-1HPPA\s0 shared libraries to have undefined symbols.
.Ip "\f(CW--no-warn-mismatch\fR" 4
Normally \f(CWld\fR will give an error if you try to link together input
files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they have
been compiled for different processors or for different endiannesses.
This option tells \f(CWld\fR that it should silently permit such possible
errors.  This option should only be used with care, in cases when you
have taken some special action that ensures that the linker errors are
inappropriate.
.Ip "\f(CW--no-whole-archive\fR" 4
Turn off the effect of the \f(CW--whole-archive\fR option for subsequent
archive files.
.Ip "\f(CW--noinhibit-exec\fR" 4
Retain the executable output file whenever it is still usable.
Normally, the linker will not produce an output file if it encounters
errors during the link process; it exits without writing an output file
when it issues any error whatsoever.
.Ip "\f(CW--oformat \fIoutput-format\fR\fR" 4
\f(CWld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \f(CWld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\fB--oformat\fR option to specify the binary format for the output
object file.  Even when \f(CWld\fR is configured to support alternative
object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as \f(CWld\fR
should be configured to produce as a default output format the most
usual format on each machine.  \fIoutput-format\fR is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can
list the available binary formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)  The script
command \f(CWOUTPUT_FORMAT\fR can also specify the output format, but
this option overrides it.  
.Ip "\f(CW-qmagic\fR" 4
This option is ignored for Linux compatibility.
.Ip "\f(CW-Qy\fR" 4
This option is ignored for \s-1SVR4\s0 compatibility.
.Ip "\f(CW--relax\fR" 4
An option with machine dependent effects.
This option is only supported on a few targets.
.Sp
On some platforms, the \fB--relax\fR option performs global
optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves addressing
in the program, such as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new
instructions in the output object file.
.Sp
On some platforms these link time global optimizations may make symbolic
debugging of the resulting executable impossible.
This is known to be
the case for the Matsushita \s-1MN10200\s0 and \s-1MN10300\s0 family of processors.
.Sp
On platforms where this is not supported, \fB--relax\fR is accepted,
but ignored.
.Ip "\f(CW--retain-symbols-file \fIfilename\fR\fR" 4
Retain \fIonly\fR the symbols listed in the file \fIfilename\fR,
discarding all others.  \fIfilename\fR is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line.  This option is especially useful in environments
(such as VxWorks)
where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve
run-time memory.
.Sp
\fB--retain-symbols-file\fR does \fInot\fR discard undefined symbols,
or symbols needed for relocations.
.Sp
You may only specify \fB--retain-symbols-file\fR once in the command
line.  It overrides \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-S\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW-rpath \fIdir\fR\fR" 4
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an \s-1ELF\s0 executable with shared objects.  All \f(CW-rpath\fR
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The \f(CW-rpath\fR option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
\f(CW-rpath-link\fR option.  If \f(CW-rpath\fR is not used when linking an
\s-1ELF\s0 executable, the contents of the environment variable
\f(CWLD_RUN_PATH\fR will be used if it is defined.
.Sp
The \f(CW-rpath\fR option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
\f(CW-L\fR options it is given.  If a \f(CW-rpath\fR option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the \f(CW-rpath\fR
options, ignoring the \f(CW-L\fR options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many \f(CW-L\fR options which may be on \s-1NFS\s0 mounted
filesystems.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \f(CW-R\fR option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the \f(CW-rpath\fR option.
.Ip "\f(CW-rpath-link \fIDIR\fR\fR" 4
When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CWld -shared\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the \f(CW-rpath-link\fR option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\f(CW-rpath-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.
.Sp
The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared
libraries.
.Ip "1." 8
Any directories specified by \f(CW-rpath-link\fR options.
.Ip "2." 8
Any directories specified by \f(CW-rpath\fR options.  The difference
between \f(CW-rpath\fR and \f(CW-rpath-link\fR is that directories
specified by \f(CW-rpath\fR options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the \f(CW-rpath-link\fR option is only effective
at link time. It is for the native linker only.
.Ip "3." 8
On an \s-1ELF\s0 system, if the \f(CW-rpath\fR and \f(CWrpath-link\fR options
were not used, search the contents of the environment variable
\f(CWLD_RUN_PATH\fR. It is for the native linker only.
.Ip "4." 8
On SunOS, if the \f(CW-rpath\fR option was not used, search any
directories specified using \f(CW-L\fR options.
.Ip "5." 8
For a native linker, the contents of the environment variable
\f(CWLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR.
.Ip "6." 8
For a native \s-1ELF\s0 linker, the directories in \f(CWDT_RUNPATH\fR or
\f(CWDT_RPATH\fR of a shared library are searched for shared
libraries needed by it. The \f(CWDT_RPATH\fR entries are ignored if
\f(CWDT_RUNPATH\fR entries exist.
.Ip "7." 8
The default directories, normally \fI/lib\fR and \fI/usr/lib\fR.
.Ip "8." 8
For a native linker on an \s-1ELF\s0 system, if the file \fI/etc/ld.so.conf\fR
exists, the list of directories found in that file.
.Sp
If the required shared library is not found, the linker will issue a
warning and continue with the link.
.Ip "\f(CW-shared\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-Bshareable\fR" 4
Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on \s-1ELF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0
and SunOS platforms.  On SunOS, the linker will automatically create a
shared library if the \f(CW-e\fR option is not used and there are
undefined symbols in the link.
.Ip "\f(CW--sort-common\fR" 4
This option tells \f(CWld\fR to sort the common symbols by size when it
places them in the appropriate output sections.  First come all the one
byte symbols, then all the two byte, then all the four byte, and then
everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.
.Ip "\f(CW--split-by-file [\fIsize\fR]\fR" 4
Similar to \f(CW--split-by-reloc\fR but creates a new output section for
each input file when \fIsize\fR is reached.  \fIsize\fR defaults to a
size of 1 if not given.
.Ip "\f(CW--split-by-reloc [\fIcount\fR]\fR" 4
Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single
output section in the file contains more than \fIcount\fR relocations.
This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the \s-1COFF\s0 object file format; since \s-1COFF\s0
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than \fIcount\fR relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  \fIcount\fR defaults to a value of 32768.
.Ip "\f(CW--stats\fR" 4
Compute and display statistics about the operation of the linker, such
as execution time and memory usage.
.Ip "\f(CW--traditional-format\fR" 4
For some targets, the output of \f(CWld\fR is different in some ways from
the output of some existing linker.  This switch requests \f(CWld\fR to
use the traditional format instead.
.Sp
For example, on SunOS, \f(CWld\fR combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
\f(CWdbx\fR program can not read the resulting program (\f(CWgdb\fR has no
trouble).  The \fB--traditional-format\fR switch tells \f(CWld\fR to not
combine duplicate entries.
.Ip "\f(CW--section-start \fIsectionname\fR=\fIorg\fR\fR" 4
Locate a section in the output file at the absolute
address given by \fIorg\fR.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to locate multiple sections in the command
line.
\fIorg\fR must be a single hexadecimal integer;
for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading
\fB0x\fR usually associated with hexadecimal values.  \fINote:\fR there
should be no white space between \fIsectionname\fR, the equals
sign (``\fB=\fR''), and \fIorg\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW-Tbss \fIorg\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-Tdata \fIorg\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW-Ttext \fIorg\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIorg\fR as the starting address for---respectively---the
\f(CWbss\fR, \f(CWdata\fR, or the \f(CWtext\fR segment of the output file.
\fIorg\fR must be a single hexadecimal integer;
for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading
\fB0x\fR usually associated with hexadecimal values.
.Ip "\f(CW--dll-verbose\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--verbose\fR" 4
Display the version number for \f(CWld\fR and list the linker emulations
supported.  Display which input files can and cannot be opened.  Display
the linker script being used by the linker.
.Ip "\f(CW--version-script=\fIversion-scriptfile\fR\fR" 4
Specify the name of a version script to the linker.  This is typically
used when creating shared libraries to specify additional information
about the version heirarchy for the library being created.  This option
is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms which support shared libraries.
.Ip "\f(CW--warn-common\fR" 4
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.
.Sp
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.Ip "\fBint i = 1;\fR" 8
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
.Ip "\fBextern int i;\fR" 8
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.Ip "\fBint i;\fR" 8
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
.Sp
The \fB--warn-common\fR option can produce five kinds of warnings.
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol
encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be
a common symbol.
.Ip "1." 8
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a
definition for the symbol.
	
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: common of `\fIsymbol\fR\*(R'
	   overridden by definition
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: defined here
.Ip "2." 8
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a later definition for
the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case,
except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.
	
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: definition of `\fIsymbol\fR\*(R'
	   overriding common
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: common is here
.Ip "3." 8
Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized common symbol.
	
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: multiple common
	   of `\fIsymbol\fR\*(R'
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: previous common is here
.Ip "4." 8
Merging a common symbol with a previous larger common symbol.
	
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: common of `\fIsymbol\fR\*(R'
	   overridden by larger common
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: larger common is here
.Ip "5." 8
Merging a common symbol with a previous smaller common symbol.  This is
the same as the previous case, except that the symbols are
encountered in a different order.
	
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: common of `\fIsymbol\fR\*(R'
	   overriding smaller common
	\fIfile\fR(\fIsection\fR): warning: smaller common is here
.Ip "\f(CW--warn-constructors\fR" 4
Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few
object file formats.  For formats like \s-1COFF\s0 or \s-1ELF\s0, the linker can not
detect the use of global constructors.
.Ip "\f(CW--warn-multiple-gp\fR" 4
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
.Ip "\f(CW--warn-once\fR" 4
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.
.Ip "\f(CW--warn-section-align\fR" 4
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the \f(CWSECTIONS\fR command does not specify a start address for
the section.
.Ip "\f(CW--whole-archive\fR" 4
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
\f(CW--whole-archive\fR option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \f(CW-Wl,-whole-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \f(CW-Wl,-no-whole-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.Ip "\f(CW--wrap \fIsymbol\fR\fR" 4
Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW__wrap_\fIsymbol\fR\fR.  Any
undefined reference to \f(CW__real_\fIsymbol\fR\fR will be resolved to
\fIsymbol\fR.
.Sp
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW__wrap_\fIsymbol\fR\fR.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
\f(CW__real_\fIsymbol\fR\fR.
.Sp
Here is a trivial example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        
\&        void *
\&        __wrap_malloc (int c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %ld\en", c);
\&          return __real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
If you link other code with this file using \f(CW--wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CWmalloc\fR will call the function \f(CW__wrap_malloc\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW__real_malloc\fR in \f(CW__wrap_malloc\fR will
call the real \f(CWmalloc\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW__real_malloc\fR function as well, so that
links without the \f(CW--wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW__real_malloc\fR in the same
file as \f(CW__wrap_malloc\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CWmalloc\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW--enable-new-dtags\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--disable-new-dtags\fR" 4
This linker can create the new dynamic tags in \s-1ELF\s0. But the older \s-1ELF\s0
systems may not understand them. If you specify
\f(CW--enable-new-dtags\fR, the dynamic tags will be created as needed.
If you specify \f(CW--disable-new-dtags\fR, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that
those options are only available for \s-1ELF\s0 systems.
.PP
The i386 \s-1PE\s0 linker supports the \f(CW-shared\fR option, which causes
the output to be a dynamically linked library (\s-1DLL\s0) instead of a
normal executable.  You should name the output \f(CW*.dll\fR when you
use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
\f(CW*.def\fR files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal
object file).
.PP
In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386 \s-1PE\s0 linker
support additional command line options that are specific to the i386
\s-1PE\s0 target.  Options that take values may be separated from their
values by either a space or an equals sign.
.Ip "\f(CW--add-stdcall-alias\fR" 4
If given, symbols with a stdcall suffix (@\fInn\fR) will be exported
as-is and also with the suffix stripped.
.Ip "\f(CW--base-file \fIfile\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIfile\fR as the name of a file in which to save the base
addresses of all the relocations needed for generating DLLs with
\fIdlltool\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW--dll\fR" 4
Create a \s-1DLL\s0 instead of a regular executable.  You may also use
\f(CW-shared\fR or specify a \f(CWLIBRARY\fR in a given \f(CW.def\fR
file.
.Ip "\f(CW--enable-stdcall-fixup\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--disable-stdcall-fixup\fR" 4
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do \*(L"fuzzy linking\*(R" by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW_foo\fR might be linked to the function
\f(CW_foo@12\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW_bar@16\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW_bar\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \f(CW--enable-stdcall-fixup\fR, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify
\f(CW--disable-stdcall-fixup\fR, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors.
.Ip "\f(CW--export-all-symbols\fR" 4
If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a \s-1DLL\s0 will
be exported by the \s-1DLL\s0.  Note that this is the default if there
otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
explicitly exported via \s-1DEF\s0 files or implicitly exported via function
attributes, the default is to not export anything else unless this
option is given.  Note that the symbols \f(CWDllMain@12\fR,
\f(CWDllEntryPoint@0\fR, \f(CWDllMainCRTStartup@12\fR, and 
\f(CWimpure_ptr\fR will not be automatically
exported.  Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be 
re-exported, nor will symbols specifying the \s-1DLL\s0's internal layout 
such as those beginning with \f(CW_head_\fR or ending with 
\f(CW_iname\fR.  In addition, no symbols from \f(CWlibgcc\fR, 
\f(CWlibstd++\fR, \f(CWlibmingw32\fR, or \f(CWcrtX.o\fR will be exported.
Symbols whose names begin with \f(CW__rtti_\fR or \f(CW__builtin_\fR will
not be exported, to help with \*(C+ DLLs.  Finally, there is an
extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported 
(obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for cygwin targets).
These cygwin-excludes are: \f(CW_cygwin_dll_entry@12\fR, 
\f(CW_cygwin_crt0_common@8\fR, \f(CW_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@12\fR,
\f(CW_fmode\fR, \f(CW_impure_ptr\fR, \f(CWcygwin_attach_dll\fR, 
\f(CWcygwin_premain0\fR, \f(CWcygwin_premain1\fR, \f(CWcygwin_premain2\fR,
\f(CWcygwin_premain3\fR, and \f(CWenviron\fR. 
.Ip "\f(CW--exclude-symbols \fIsymbol\fR,\fIsymbol\fR,...\fR" 4
Specifies a list of symbols which should not be automatically
exported.  The symbol names may be delimited by commas or colons.
.Ip "\f(CW--file-alignment\fR" 4
Specify the file alignment.  Sections in the file will always begin at
file offsets which are multiples of this number.  This defaults to
512.
.Ip "\f(CW--heap \fIreserve\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--heap \fIreserve\fR,\fIcommit\fR\fR" 4
Specify the amount of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be
used as heap for this program.  The default is 1Mb reserved, 4K
committed.
.Ip "\f(CW--image-base \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Use \fIvalue\fR as the base address of your program or dll.  This is
the lowest memory location that will be used when your program or dll
is loaded.  To reduce the need to relocate and improve performance of
your dlls, each should have a unique base address and not overlap any
other dlls.  The default is 0x400000 for executables, and 0x10000000
for dlls.
.Ip "\f(CW--kill-at\fR" 4
If given, the stdcall suffixes (@\fInn\fR) will be stripped from
symbols before they are exported.
.Ip "\f(CW--major-image-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the major number of the \*(L"image version\*(R".  Defaults to 1.
.Ip "\f(CW--major-os-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the major number of the \*(L"os version\*(R".  Defaults to 4.
.Ip "\f(CW--major-subsystem-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the major number of the \*(L"subsystem version\*(R".  Defaults to 4.
.Ip "\f(CW--minor-image-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the minor number of the \*(L"image version\*(R".  Defaults to 0.
.Ip "\f(CW--minor-os-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the minor number of the \*(L"os version\*(R".  Defaults to 0.
.Ip "\f(CW--minor-subsystem-version \fIvalue\fR\fR" 4
Sets the minor number of the \*(L"subsystem version\*(R".  Defaults to 0.
.Ip "\f(CW--output-def \fIfile\fR\fR" 4
The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain a \s-1DEF\s0
file corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating.  This \s-1DEF\s0 file
(which should be called \f(CW*.def\fR) may be used to create an import
library with \f(CWdlltool\fR or may be used as a reference to
automatically or implicitly exported symbols.
.Ip "\f(CW--out-implib \fIfile\fR\fR" 4
The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain an
import lib corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating. This
import lib (which should be called \f(CW*.dll.a\fR or \f(CW*.a\fR
may be used to link clients against the generated \s-1DLL\s0; this behavior
makes it possible to skip a separate \f(CWdlltool\fR import library
creation step.
.Ip "\f(CW--enable-auto-image-base\fR" 4
Automatically choose the image base for DLLs, unless one is specified
using the \f(CW--image-base\fR argument.  By using a hash generated
from the dllname to create unique image bases for each \s-1DLL\s0, in-memory
collisions and relocations which can delay program execution are
avoided.
.Ip "\f(CW--disable-auto-image-base\fR" 4
Do not automatically generate a unique image base.  If there is no
user-specified image base (\f(CW--image-base\fR) then use the platform
default.
.Ip "\f(CW--dll-search-prefix \fIstring\fR\fR" 4
When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library, i
search for \f(CW<string><basename>.dll\fR in preference to 
\f(CWlib<basename>.dll\fR. This behavior allows easy distinction
between DLLs built for the various \*(L"subplatforms": native, cygwin,
uwin, pw, etc.  For instance, cygwin DLLs typically use
\f(CW--dll-search-prefix=cyg\fR. 
.Ip "\f(CW--enable-auto-import\fR" 4
Do sophisticated linking of \f(CW_symbol\fR to \f(CW__imp__symbol\fR for 
\s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when 
building the DLLs with those \s-1DATA\s0 exports.  This generally will \*(L'just 
work\*(R' -- but sometimes you may see this message:
.Sp
\*(L"variable \*(L'<var>\*(R' can't be auto-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's \f(CW--enable-auto-import\fR for details.\*(R"
.Sp
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address 
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only 
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member 
fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL\s0, as well as using a 
constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL\s0.  There are
several ways to address this difficulty.
.Sp
One solution is to force one of the \*(L'constants\*(R' to be a variable -- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the \*(L'constant\*(R' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
or
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
For structs, the only option is to make the struct itself variable:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field --> 
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field }
.Ve
A second method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto-import\*(R' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
\f(CW__declspec(dllimport)\fR.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL\s0, building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL\s0, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the \*(L'direct address with 
constant offset\*(R' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp
Original:
	
	--foo.h
	extern int arr[];
	--foo.c
	#include \*(L"foo.h\*(R"
	void \fImain\fR\|(int argc, char **argv){
	  \fIprintf\fR\|("%d\en\*(R",arr[1]);
	}
.Sp
Solution 1:
	
	--foo.h
	extern int arr[];
	--foo.c
	#include \*(L"foo.h\*(R"
	void \fImain\fR\|(int argc, char **argv){
	  /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not \*(L"optimize\*(R" */
	  volatile int *parr = arr;
	  \fIprintf\fR\|("%d\en\*(R",parr[1]);
	}
.Sp
Solution 2:
	
	--foo.h
	/* Note: auto-export is assumed (no \fI_\|_declspec\fR\|(dllexport)) */
	#if (\fIdefined\fR\|(_WIN32) || \fIdefined\fR\|(_\|_CYGWIN_\|_)) && \e
	  !(\fIdefined\fR\|(\s-1FOO_BUILD_DLL\s0) || \fIdefined\fR\|(\s-1FOO_STATIC\s0))
	#define \s-1FOO_IMPORT\s0 \fI_\|_declspec\fR\|(dllimport)
	#else
	#define \s-1FOO_IMPORT\s0
	#endif
	extern \s-1FOO_IMPORT\s0 int arr[];
	--foo.c
	#include \*(L"foo.h\*(R"
	void \fImain\fR\|(int argc, char **argv){
	  \fIprintf\fR\|("%d\en\*(R",arr[1]);
	}
.Sp
A third way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).
.Ip "\f(CW--disable-auto-import\fR" 4
Do not attempt to do sophisticalted linking of \f(CW_symbol\fR to 
\f(CW__imp__symbol\fR for \s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs.
.Ip "\f(CW--enable-extra-pe-debug\fR" 4
Show additional debug info related to auto-import symbol thunking.
.Ip "\f(CW--section-alignment\fR" 4
Sets the section alignment.  Sections in memory will always begin at
addresses which are a multiple of this number.  Defaults to 0x1000.
.Ip "\f(CW--stack \fIreserve\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--stack \fIreserve\fR,\fIcommit\fR\fR" 4
Specify the amount of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be
used as stack for this program.  The default is 2Mb reserved, 4K
committed.
.Ip "\f(CW--subsystem \fIwhich\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--subsystem \fIwhich\fR:\fImajor\fR\fR" 4
.Ip "\f(CW--subsystem \fIwhich\fR:\fImajor\fR.\fIminor\fR\fR" 4
Specifies the subsystem under which your program will execute.  The
legal values for \fIwhich\fR are \f(CWnative\fR, \f(CWwindows\fR,
\f(CWconsole\fR, and \f(CWposix\fR.  You may optionally set the
subsystem version also.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
You can change the behavior of \f(CWld\fR with the environment variables
\f(CWGNUTARGET\fR, \f(CWLDEMULATION\fR, and \f(CWCOLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\fR.
.PP
\f(CWGNUTARGET\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB--format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is no
\f(CWGNUTARGET\fR in the environment, \f(CWld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CWGNUTARGET\fR is set to \f(CWdefault\fR then BFD
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
BFD on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\f(CWLDEMULATION\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB--verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CWLDEMULATION\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\f(CWCOLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CWgcc\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB--demangle\fR and \fB--no-demangle\fR
options.
